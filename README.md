The "New Sphere" button creates a sphere that moves along a spiral path. <br />
Pressing the spacebar stops movement for 5s and shows the path information for each sphere. <br />
The color of the sphere changes with distance from the center of the spiral. <br />
The sphere that reaches the center of the spiral shrinks and then explodes. <br />
Destroyed spheres are removed from the scene. <br />
One "Input System" extension version 1.4.4 has been installed.
Unity version: 2020.3.26.
